#What is this?
This mod is an addon to [Hexy's AngelBob Tweaks](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Hexy_AngelBob_Tweaks) that adds compatibility with MadClown's mods as well as adds some other tweaks for MadClown's mods. All options for this mod are disabled by default, as they can break your save game if you are using the things this mod removes/tweaks. In addition, this modifies some of Hexy's AngelBob Tweaks's options to do additional things for MadClown's mods: these options are listed below.

#Options
##Hexy's AngelBob Tweaks Options
- Clean up Angel's casting recipes: Also disables unused MadClown's plate recipes. Some plate recipes are re-enabled if MadClown's Science is present as it adds new uses to previously unused plates.
- Remove Bob's fluids and Bob's materials tabs: Overrides MadClown's Processing changes to the Bob's fluids/materials tabs.
- Add nuclear tab: Also works with MadClown's nuclear mods.
- Reorganize military tab: Also works with the new nuclear weapons MadClown's nuclear mods add.
##"Removing Things" Options (off by default)
- Remove particle accelerators: Remove particle accelerators and the free science pack from power recipes.
- Remove research facilities: Remove research facilities and the science packs from fluids recipes.
- Remove alternate red/yellow ammo recipes: Remove the alternate recipes MadClown's adds for yellow ammo and red ammo.

##Balance/Restructuring Tweaks (off by default)
- Tweak nuclear: Disable thorium-plutionium fuel cells, as well as remove the polluiton modifier that Bob's mods add to normal nuclear fuel.
- Buff uranium hexafluoride centrifuging: Make it so that hexafluoride centrifuging uses closer to 1/2 the uranium ore used for normal uranium ore centrifuging rather than 2/3 the uranium ore used.
- Fix pure sorting recipe crafting times: Make MadClown's pure ore sorting recipes have 1/1.5 second crafting times instead of 0.5 second crafting times.
- MadClown's crystals require acid: Make it so making MadClown's crystals actually requires the respective acid from the chunk stage rather than requiring no acid.
- Buff sand/alluvium sluicing: Make sand sluicing have 2.5x the yield, and alluvium sluicing have 5x the yield these recipes normally do to make them more appealing.
- Remove desalination for magnesium recipes: Remove the magnesium from salt water desalination recipes, as they make obtaining magnesium too easy.
- Rebalance MadClown's science pack recipes: More expensive science pack recipes have double the yield, and less expensive science pack recipes have less yield. Make the automation science pack II recipe require less materials. Make the logistic science pack II recipe require more chrome to compensate for the decreased alloy requirement of the default recipe. Switch cobalt plate and osmium plate in the production science pack III and high tech science pack III recipes.
